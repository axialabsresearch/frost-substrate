# Selective State Monitoring Protocol (SSMP)

SSMP is a Substrate-native protocol that abstracts over GRANDPA using finality predicates to proactively monitor finalized events.

Upon finality, it triggers the generation of cryptographic proofs for targeted state transitions, enabling highly selective and efficient state monitoring, ideal for bridging and interoperability layers.
